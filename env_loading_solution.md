## Environment Variables Loading Issue

The error occurs because the environment variables are not being loaded from your .env file. While you have created a .env file, you need to use a package like `python-dotenv` to load these variables into the environment.

Here's how to fix this:

1. First, install python-dotenv:
```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

2. Modify your `supabase-client.py` file to load the environment variables. Add this near the top of the file, before accessing any environment variables:
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # This loads the variables from .env
```

3. Make sure your .env file contains the required variables:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key_here
```

After making these changes, your script should be able to access the environment variables correctly.

The full updated supabase-client.py should look like this:
```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from supabase import create_client, Client

load_dotenv()  # Load environment variables from .env

url: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_URL")
key: str = os.environ.get("SUPABASE_KEY")

if not url or not key:
    raise ValueError("Missing required environment variables")

supabase: Client = create_client(url, key)
```

Make sure your .env file is in the same directory as your script and contains the correct Supabase credentials.
