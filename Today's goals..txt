Today's goals.

I will be able to access and interact with the worklog database using python's supabase-py library.

I will build a react application and a restful API that will fetch and update data from a simple intuitive user interface.

The interface will be responsive and enable users to create, update or delete entries.

I will make sure to set up media upload so that users can include images or videos as part of the record.

I want a description of the task done, an image, the time of day and amount of time spent on the task.


I have configured a user interface that interacts with the database and retrieves information, and displays it intuitively on the User interface.

The edit functionality is working correctly. 

I should implement add task and delete task functionality correctly.

User should be able to generate a weekly summary for 7 days.
